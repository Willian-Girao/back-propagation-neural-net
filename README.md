# Machine Learning Models

Implementations in C of Machine Learning models (WIP).

* **Suport Vector Machine**
* **Back Propagation Neural Network**

## Suport Vector Machine (SVM)

A standar implementation of a standard SVM to perform binary classification.

## Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

A standar implementation of a standard backpropagation neural network to perform binary classification.
