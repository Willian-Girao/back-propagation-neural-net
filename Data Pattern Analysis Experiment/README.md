#W.I.P.
Ongoing experiments for novel classifier model validation.

# Data Analysis Experiment

1. Get, for each dimension, the standard deviation.
2. Sort them by decreasing order.
3. Plot them.

- What does it look like?
- What about the inter-dimensional variation?
- Does the vector composed by those characteristics represent the "true characteristics" that tell the data-points apart?

-> 3D study-case better for visual analysis and validation of the previously asked questions and previously made assumptions.

-> Dimensionality complexity can be decreased by selecting a subset of the most discriminant characteristics.

-> Data-size complexity could be decreased by working with "group-size representative inference".
